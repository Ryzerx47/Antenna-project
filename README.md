# Antenna-project
Here we have designed a microstrip array antennas for wireless communication application
For design you can go to the design branch in this repo
For practical and simulation results you can go to the Results branch in this repo

# RESONANT FREQUENCY (GHz): 
Without Fractal Geometry: The simulated frequency is consistently at 2.37 GHz, while the practical 
frequency is slightly lower at 2.3 GHz for all elements. 
With Fractal Geometry: Similar results are observed, with a simulated frequency of 2.37 GHz and a 
practical frequency of 2.3 GHz for all cases. 
Both methods show close agreement between simulated and practical results, with a slight deviation 
due to real-world factors. 
# GAIN (dB): 
Without Fractal Geometry: Gain improves as the number of elements increases: - 1 element: 0.62 dB - 2 elements: 3.84 dB - 4 elements: 5.9 dB - 8 elements: 7.6 dB 
With Fractal Geometry: Gain values are consistently higher: - 1 element: 0.78 dB - 2 elements: 3.85 dB - 4 elements: 5.84 dB - 8 elements: 7.2 dB 
# RETURN LOSS (dB):  
Without Fractal Geometry: Return loss improves (becomes more negative) with an increasing number 
of elements: - 1 element: -21.45 dB - 2 elements: -24.787 dB - 4 elements: -24.013 dB - 8 elements: -36.472 dB 
With Fractal Geometry: The return loss shows even better values, indicating improved performance: - 1 element: -25.02 dB - 2 elements: -26.068 dB - 4 elements: -33.36 dB - 8 elements: -46.93 dB 
Fractal geometry improves return loss across all configurations, making it a better design for reducing      
signal reflection.
